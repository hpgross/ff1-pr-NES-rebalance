# ff1-pr-NES-rebalance
A NES Rebalance Mod for FF1 Pixel Remaster

The goal of this mod is to document the formulas used for both the Pixel Remaster and the NES releases, and to make a modification to make the former similar to the latter. In situations where game balance is off, I would consider Final Fantasy Restored as a guide towards what the goal should be.

Installation instructions:

1. Download BepInEx Loader + FF# from: https://github.com/Albeoris/Memoria.FF1
2. Extract to the root of your game install.
3. Run your game + close it.
4. Navigate to InstallDir\BepInEx\config and open Memoria.ffpr.cfg
5. Set ExportEnabled = true
6. Run your game again, wait a bit for extraction to complete then close it.
7. Navigate to: InstallDir\FINAL FANTASY_Data\StreamingAssets\Assets\GameAssets\Serial\Data and paste the contents of NES_rebalance.7z inside.
8. Launch the game again and the changes will be applied automatically

If you only want the character stat changes, and want to leave bosses as they were, do not include monster.csv. If you don't want the item price/healing changes, do not include item.csv, armor.csv, ability.csv, or weapon.csv.

For Memoria Partial:

1. Do all the steps above up to 6.
2. Navigate to:  InstallDir\FINAL FANTASY_Data\StreamingAssets, create a Mods folder and paste the contents of the Memoria Partial folder inside.
3. Launch the game again and the changes will be applied automatically

For Magicite:

1. Do all the steps above up to 6.
2. Navigate to:  InstallDir\FINAL FANTASY_Data\StreamingAssets, create a Magicite folder and paste the contents of the Magicite folder inside.
